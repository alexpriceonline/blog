# I hate new projects

Well, not really. I love the thrill of starting a new project. Designs and features floating around in my head, exciting stuff.

What’s not exciting however, is spending 2-3 hours setting up a new project every time I want to build a little front-end snippet. Trying to decide how to structure the project and remembering what dependancies I need. It's boring.

I looked for an existing solution but couldn't find anything that fit my needs. All of the boilerplate projects I tested made assumptions about technologies, came with two many dependancies and in the end, **didn't actually save me time**.

### So I built my own

##### Introducing the FrontendGems Boilerplate

The boilerplate is a barebones HTML and SCSS starter-kit. It makes starting a new web project a breeze and will have you up and coding in minutes.

It has all of the basic things you need and none of the stuff you don’t. No Javascript pre-processor. No mammoth front-end frameworks (_I'm looking at you bootstrap_). It's a straightforward directory structure and simple build system for SCSS.

For a more in-depth look at what's included in the boilerplate, please read the full gem page or view the repository on GitHub.
